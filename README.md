This project was started in 2016 to automate the ETL (extract, transform, load) of MCP data into a reporting dashboard.

See the PDF documents in the docs folder for specific details on scope, design, process, APIs, etc.

Note: this code is non-functional because the script that performs the actual etl was too proprietary to include. All the scripts here provide the framework for getting specific data from remote MySQL databases to the central server and for extracting the data from MongoDB once it is transformed.
